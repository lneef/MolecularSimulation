MolSim is a simulator for simulating the movement of planets and molecules.

The following command line options are supported:

    -e      Expects an argument of type double. Using this option the end time of the simulation can be set.
            The default end time is 1000

    -t      Expects an argument of type double. Using this option the time step (delta\_t) of the simulation can be set.
            The default time step is 0.014

    -l     Expects as argument either off, info, debug, trace or error. Using this option the global log_level can be set. The default level is info.

    --planet Usage: --planet path-to-file. Using this command line option particles are read from the specified file and
             the planet simulation is started.

    --cub   Using this option the molecular simulation is started. Particle are generated from cuboid which are either read
            from a file or from the command line. In the former case --cub=path-to-file has to be used and in the latter
            --cub.

    --xml   Usage: --xml path-to-xml-file. Using this option all data for the simualtion can be read from an xml file.
                -e and -t are ignored by this option.

    --help  This page is printed.

    You must use the options --planet or --cub if you want to run a simulation.
